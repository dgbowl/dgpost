**dgpost**: Datagram postprocessing tools
=========================================

A set of datagram postprocessing tools, functions, visualisations and export scripts.

dgpost is a Python library aimed at reproducible postprocessing of time-resolved 
data. It provides functions to load data from `datagrams` and :class:`pd.DataFrames`,
automatic datapoint interpolation using unix timestamps, a library of transformation
functions which contains implementations of common calculations in chemistry, catalysis,
electrochemistry, etc., and functions to save and plot the calculated data.

dgpost relies on the `recipe` schema, defined in the :mod:`dgbowl_schemas.dgpost_recipe`
module of that package. 

In addition to the above, dgpost is fully unit- and uncertainty-aware, using the 
`pint <https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and 
`uncertainties <https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/>`_ packages.
