**dgpost** usage
----------------
dgpost is intended for use in two modes:

- with a recipe as an executable: ``dgpost <recipe.yml>``
- as a Python library (``import dgpost``)

These two usage modes are described below:

**dgpost** as an executable
```````````````````````````
This is the main user-focused way of using dgpost. The user should craft a 
`recipe`, written in ``yaml``, which includes a prescription of the steps to be
performed by dgpost. Currently supported steps are:

- :mod:`dgpost.utils.load`: load a `datagram` or a :class:`pd.DataFrame`
- :mod:`dgpost.utils.extract`: extract and interpolate data from the loaded files 
  into a table
- :mod:`dgpost.utils.transform`: use a function from the :mod:`dgpost.transform` 
  library to process the data in the table, creating new columns
- :mod:`dgpost.utils.plot`: plot parts of the table using our custom wrapper 
  around :mod:`matplotlib`
- :mod:`dgpost.utils.save`: export the created table for further use

Each of the above keywords can be only specified once in the `recipe`, however more
than one command can be specified for each of the keywords (i.e. it's possible to 
``load`` multiple files, apply several ``transform`` functions, etc.). Detailed 
syntax of each of the above steps is further described in the documentation of each
of the keywords within the :mod:`dgpost.utils` module.

**dgpost** as a Python library
``````````````````````````````
For advanced users and more complex workflows, dgpost can be also imported as a
standard python library with ``import dgpost``. The functions within dgpost are
split into two key modules:

- :mod:`dgpost.utils` module, containing the ancilliary data management functions
  of dgbowl, and
- :mod:`dgpost.transform` module, containing all "scientific" data transformation
  functions.

See the documentation of the two respective modules for details. The functionality
of dgpost can be used from within e.g. Jupyter notebooks in this way.
